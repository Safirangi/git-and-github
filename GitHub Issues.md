# GitHub Issues & Best Practises 
- GitHub Issues is a lightweight issue-tracking system that is available in all GitHub repositories. When you create a GitHub repo, you get GitHub Issues out of the box, and 
more often than not, you keep using it as your project evolves.
- In most cases, GitHub Issues is used for reporting bugs and requesting features. Sometimes it hosts discussions, helps process support requests, or even submit documentation 
feedback.

### Best Practice 1: If Youâ€™re Just Starting, Go With the Defaults
- If your repository is brand-new, you don't have a lot of issues reported, and you want to enable all kinds and forms of feedback to flow in, just keep the default settings 
for your GitHub Issues.
- You will be able to interact with users freely without limiting what they can report and have insightful discussions that may not necessarily be actionable. This could be a 
good idea in the early stages of your project when you're still getting a feel for your users and the problems they face.

### Best Practice 2: Encourage Search to Avoid Duplication

### How to associate commits with GitHub issues
- To link a commit to a GitHub Issue, put the issue number with the # character in the Comment text box. For example, #111.
- To close a GitHub issue, put a keyword and put the issue number with the # character in the Comment text box. For example, Close #111.
- Keywords to close a GitHub Issue : To close a GitHub issue, you can use any of the following keywords:
  - Close
  - Closes
  - Closed
  - Fix
  - Fixes
  - Fixed
  - Resolve
  - Resolves
  - Resolved

### Referencing related commits in an Issue
Commits can be referenced in an Issue Comment by writing the SHA-hash of the commit, and it'll automatically get turned into a link.
